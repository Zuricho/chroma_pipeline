# Chroma Pipeline
Protein design pipeline for using Chroma, a protein structure generation model, for various tasks



## Installation

Folder tree should like:

```
.
└── chroma_pipeline
    ├── chroma
    │   include chroma package here
    ├── chroma_weights
    │   chroma weights here, it should be downloaded from GenerateBio
    └── README.md
```

Install chroma with conda: (this might be incorrect for now)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zuricho/chroma_pipeline.git
cd chroma_pipeline
conda create -n chroma python=3.9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
